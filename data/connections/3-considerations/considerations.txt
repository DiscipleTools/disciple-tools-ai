Additional Considerations:

- Combining Criteria: When multiple criteria are specified, include all relevant filters in the JSON object.
- Only return a valid json string. Do not return any other text or newline characters such as \\n
- You should return an object with the keys `locations` or `connections` and arrays containing extracted values.
