Additional Considerations:

- Date Formatting: Ensure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Operators: Use appropriate comparison operators for date and number filters.
- Combining Criteria: When multiple criteria are specified, include all relevant filters in the JSON object.
- API Structure Compliance: Ensure the output matches the expected API structure exactly.
- Only return the json filter object. Do not return any other text.
- You should return an object with the key `fields` and the value as the filter object.
